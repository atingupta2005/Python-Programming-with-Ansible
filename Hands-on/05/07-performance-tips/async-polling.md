### Long-Running Command with Async and Polling

```yaml
- name: Run a long-running command asynchronously
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Start a long-running process
      command: /bin/sleep 300   # Simulates a long-running task (sleep for 5 minutes)
      async: 600               # Allow up to 10 minutes for the task to complete
      poll: 10                 # Check the status every 10 seconds
      register: long_running_task

    - name: Check the status of the long-running task
      async_status:
        jid: "{{ long_running_task.ansible_job_id }}"
      register: job_status
      until: job_status.finished
      retries: 60              # Retry every 10 seconds, up to 10 minutes
      delay: 10                # Wait 10 seconds between retries

    - name: Report the result of the long-running task
      debug:
        msg: "The long-running task completed with status: {{ job_status.result.rc }}"
```

### Explanation

1. **Start a Long-Running Process**:
   - This task runs the command `/bin/sleep 300`, which simulates a long-running task by sleeping for 5 minutes. It is allowed up to 10 minutes to complete (`async: 600`), and Ansible will poll every 10 seconds (`poll: 10`) to check its status.

2. **Check the Status of the Long-Running Task**:
   - The `async_status` module checks the status of the long-running task using the job ID from the previous task. It retries every 10 seconds up to 10 minutes (`retries: 60`, `delay: 10`) until the task is finished.

3. **Report the Result**:
   - Finally, this task uses the `debug` module to display the result of the long-running task, showing the return code (`rc`).
