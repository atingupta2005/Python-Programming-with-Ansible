# Command module
 - It's like a shell module. Both will give same result
    - ansible all -m shell -a "uptime"
    - ansible all -m command -a "uptime"
    - ansible all -a "uptime"
      - By Default command is the default module
  - With command module the command will be executed without being proceeded through a shell
    - As a consequence some variablles like $home are not available
    - Also some stream operations like \<, \>, | and & will not work
    - The command module is more secure, because it will not be affected by the user's environment
